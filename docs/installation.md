# Installation

Use this package as a library.

## Add Dependency

To add this package to your project, run the appropriate command for your environment:

### With Dart

```shell
dart pub add xconn
```

### With Flutter

```shell
flutter pub add xconn
```

This will add a line like this to your package's pubspec.yaml (and run an implicit dart pub get):

```yaml
dependencies:
  xconn: ^0.1.0
```

Alternatively, your editor might support `dart pub get` or `flutter pub get`. Check the docs for
your editor to learn more.

### Import it

Now in your Dart code, you can use:

```dart
import 'package:xconn/xconn.dart';
```
